Vectory provides pairwise vector image conversion for Ruby applications, supporting EPS, PS, EMF, SVG, and PDF formats through integration with external conversion tools.

toc::[]

== Welcome

Vectory helps you:

* **Convert** between vector image formats (EPS, PS, EMF, SVG, PDF)
* **Preserve** document metadata and bounding boxes
* **Leverage** external tools (Inkscape, Ghostscript, emf2svg) for reliable conversions
* **Process** images from files, content, or data URIs
* **Query** image dimensions without full rendering

== Quick Navigation

=== By Your Role

**Application Developer**::
Start with link:features/ruby-api/[Ruby API] to integrate Vectory into your applications.

**Metanorma User**::
Start with link:guides/metanorma-integration[Metanorma Integration] for SVG mapping in XML documents.

**Library Maintainer**::
Start with link:understanding/architecture[Architecture] to understand Vectory's design.

== Requirements

Vectory requires external tools for vector image conversion:

=== Required Tools

* **Inkscape** (version 0.92 or later recommended)
** for SVG ↔ EPS/PS/EMF/PDF conversions
** for dimension queries
** Version 1.0+ recommended; 1.3.0 for Windows (1.3.1+ has EPS/PS issues)

* **Ghostscript** (version 9.0 or later)
** for EPS/PS → PDF conversion (bounding box preservation)
** required for EPS and PS format support

* **Ruby** (version 3.1 or later)
** runtime environment for Vectory gem

=== Ruby Gems (installed automatically)

* **emf2svg** (~> 1.0)
** for EMF → SVG conversion
** provides Windows EMF format support

* **moxml** (~> 0.5)
** for XML/HTML parsing (Metanorma integration)

See link:getting-started/installation[Installation] for detailed setup instructions including platform-specific requirements.
